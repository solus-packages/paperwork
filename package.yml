description: |
    Paperwork is a personal document manager. It manages scanned documents and PDFs.
    It iss designed to be easy and fast to use. The idea behind Paperwork is "scan & forget": You
    can just scan a new document and forget about it until the day you need it again.
    In other words, let the machine do most of the work for you.
